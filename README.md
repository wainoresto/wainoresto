#Who is Noah?

I'll be using this space to help me develop skills and understanding related to GitHub processes and also capture and document important things that come up in my professional life. 

The goal is use this space as a learning plaform for myself and others and find a way to leverage the lessons learned for something behind my coporate professional life.

- I'm currently a technical writer and illustrator that has experience in a wide variety of business spaces.
- I moonlight as a jiu jitsu instructor and practitioner in my free time. Presently a black belt ðŸ¥‹
- Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn - [link coming soon...]
